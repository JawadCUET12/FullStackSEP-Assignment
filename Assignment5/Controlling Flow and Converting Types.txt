Controlling Flow and Converting Types 
1.What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
It throws a DivideByZero Exception. It gets to compile time error.
 
2.What happens when you divide a double variable by 0? 
It doesn't throw an exception, it results in positive infinity, negative infinity or not a number.

3.What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its range? 
It depends on the execution context. In a checked context, an Overflow Exception is thrown.In unchecked 
context, the most significant bits of the result are discarded and execution continues

4.What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?
x=y++ means the code will be read first when executing and do the x=y+1 after it has been read.
x=++y means that it will first increase x=y+1 and then read the code.
 
5.What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop statement? 
break terminates the closest enclosing iteration statement
continue statement starts a new iteration of the closest enclosing iteration statement
return execution of the loop in which it appears and returns control to the caller.

6.What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?
initilizer section that is executed once
the condition section that determines the next iteration in the loopshould be executed or not
the iterator section that defines what happens after each execution of the body of the loop
 
7.What is the difference between the = and == operators? 
== is the comparison operator and is used to compare two variables or constants.
= is an assignment operator and is used to assign a value to a variable

8.Does the following statement compile? for ( ; true; ) ;
No
 
9.What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression?
Its a discard. Its a placeholder variable that we never intend to use.
 
10.What interface must an object implement to be enumerated over by using the foreach statement?
IEunemerable Interface
